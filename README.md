CONTENTS:

[Data]: This directory contains compiled zircons compositions from I-type, S-type and TTG rocks worldwide. For each zircon analyses, 17 variables—including 11 REEs (Ce, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), Th, U and 4 derived trace element ratios (Th/U, U/Yb, Ce/Ce* and Eu/Eu*)—were provided in a csv format (Zircons.csv). The reference sources of all these data can be found in online SI Appendix of this paper.

[Code]: This directory contains two program in python format. The program includes two parts: model training and model testing.

[Model]: This directory contains two trained model.
